COMPILATION AND RUNNING: How to run ðŸ‘‡ <br><br>

I open the project in eclipse. All my codes are inside src/com/kce/sports with model, main, exceptions packages.  
First I compile the model and exceptions codes. After that I run SportsLeagueMain.java which is in main package.  
When I run it, the menu comes in console. I just type numbers 1 to 7 to use the project.  THATS IT!
